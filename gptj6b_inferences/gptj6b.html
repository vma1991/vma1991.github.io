<h3>The story of a Sibelius</h3>
<p><strong>This story I'm telling you is about</strong> a Sibelius, as I said at the beginning.</p>
<p>Most of what you read here, about Sibelius and his work, was told to me by Sibelius himself, on a couple of occasions, and at many times, in the course of a 50-year friendship. That friendship began when Sibelius was staying at the Hotel Baltic, in Goteborg, Sweden, to conduct the first of his two concerts there in August 1897. He was accompanied on the piano by a young man of perhaps 18 years of age, and described as a "frightfully funny" boy. He told the conductor that he thought the boy would be a great help, as he knew the piece inside out, having played it many times on his small guitar. He wanted him to play the theme for the entire work.</p>
<p>This was Kalevi Aho, who would have a very distinguished career, as conductor, orchestral soloist and teacher. He led the Finnish National Symphony Orchestra until 1922. His career also spanned international activities, as he conducted the Beethoven oratorio Fidelio in both London and New York, in 1897, 1899 and 1904, and also in San Francisco, in 1910. In the U.S.A., he was a regular guest conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, as well as of the Philadelphia Orchestra and of the New York Philharmonic.</p>
<p>In 1912, the year the Sibelius Violin Concerto came out, he had already conducted its 'Adagio' in London. Then, in 1913, he heard a recording of the work on Edison wax cylinder, conducted by Artur Niklasson, which moved him to give the first performance of the new piece in Helsinki on 9 May.</p>
<p>Kalevi Aho studied conducting at the Copenhagen Music Academy under Ole Olsen (1839-1918). He had succeeded in learning Finnish when he was only 18, and knew Swedish as well. On 9 May 1914, he had also conducted the Symphony No. 5, Op. 65, with the 'Warsaw Philharmonic'. I think that the BBC archives contain some of his concerts with the orchestra.</p>
<h3>The best ever Debian</h3>
<p><strong>Debian is being carefully and conscientiously put together and will be maintained and supported with similar care.</strong> If you like it please help make this the best ever Debian. If it is perfect and you can do nothing to improve it please join in. We want Debian to be, as Debian Software Developer Michel Suignard puts it, 'a resource for the user, a source of good advice, a job site, a gallery of goodness'.</p>
<p>This page will be kept current, but old articles are being deleted to keep the home page responsive. Use the archive menu to browse all articles.</p>
<p>In recent years, Debian has seen a growing awareness of the importance of documentation for newcomers. However, Debian documentation is not only a support tool for its users, but also an important resource for interested developers, Debian maintainers, and even upstream developers. Debian manuals should not be seen as "the user guide", since it does not treat newcomers as "users" and because it is not meant as a teaching tool.</p>
<p>To help provide the best possible help to all Debian users, the Debian documentation team strives to produce easily-read, up-to-date documentation. A welcome goal of the documentation team is to always be providing helpful information for users, whether those users are first-time or even advanced users. This document is the documentation team's initiative to provide introductory instructions to Debian system administrators and users who want to learn more about Debian documentation and writing. It will help to guide newcomers as they transition to using Debian to create software or systems.</p>
<p>Do not expect the documentation team to cover all the bases for you! That's why the documentation team works closely with the Debian installers and distributions to keep the documentation accurate and up-to-date. The documentation team looks to the contributions of the users themselves to help to fill in any documentation gaps. The full capabilities of the Debian documentation suite are being explored to increase the level of coverage.</p>
<p>There is a list of currently planned sections for the documentation that will eventually be filled in. In the meantime, consider writing some sections of the documentation for the Debian documentation team and for the whole project. If you would like to help fill out the documentation, you may find it useful to read through the documentation and see where the documentation gaps exist.</p>
<p>The Debian documentation team is also seeking suggestions from the Debian community as to what documentation might be useful. The resources section has information on how to create Debian documentation, as well as the output formats used by the documentation team.</p>
<h3>On the road</h3>
<p><strong>What you could call my life on the road began when I first met Dean Moriarty, not long after my wife and I separated.</strong> It was at a book club in New Jersey, shortly after our divorce, and Moriarty, who was in the midst of launching a career as a single writer, had just finished reading an old friend's memoir. It was the first time I had heard of Moriarty, but I was intrigued. My friend—a man who prided himself on being as unspoiled as possible by fame—had described him as "a gentleman and a flirt, when he feels like it," who showed up at his place in New Jersey unannounced and left with an overnight bag, never to return. That was my first encounter with Moriarty. It was enough. I would see if I could get to know the man who made my friend seem so modest.</p>
<p>Once I saw the full story, the rumors began. How many people in the world have experienced the moment when a beautiful young woman pulls a disheveled man up from a bar stool to his feet and leans in for a kiss? I never found out. To put it in the terms of popular culture, I know him as a wild man, a party man, a hit man, a traveling salesman, a mama's boy. In more than thirty years, he's appeared in more than seventy films, directed five, and written one book, among them the story of a couple, a woman and a man, with their own son, the son who runs away. But I never think of him as a man who is interested in being anyone's mother's boy. "I just could never live as a person and be successful," he says. "So I don't know why I'd be a mother's boy."</p>
<p>I never quite get why a woman would kiss a man she doesn't know. I once spent a weekend sleeping on a mattress on a hardwood floor of an unfurnished apartment on a tiny patch of land in northern Michigan. I shared the apartment with someone who was little more than a girl in most ways, and I had kissed her at least once. She was an excellent kisser. I think the kiss was the first real kiss I'd ever had, and it may have been the last. What it did was leave a bruise. It was a big, damp kiss, a six-second, soft tongue salvo, in which my friend's mouth touched my mouth, but her hands were busy elsewhere.</p>
